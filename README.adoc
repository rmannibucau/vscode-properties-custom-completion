= VSCode Properties Completion

Idea is to add as *first* line of the properties file to enhance completion for this pattern:

[source,properties]
----
# vscode_properties_completion_proposals=/path/to/completion.properties
----

It will request the extension to read `/path/to/completion.properties` to provide completion for the keys for the file.

IMPORTANT: ensure to use `properties` file type and NOT `Java properties`.

The content of `/path/to/completion.properties` just respects `key.which.can.be.completed = description of the key` *per line*.

== Installing

For now the extension is not published so you have to follow these steps to install it:

* Build it (`npm i && npm run compile`)
* Package it in your vscode (`./node_modules/.bin/vsce package`) - answer `y` to the question about license

This last step created a `properties-completion-1.0.0.vsix`

Now you can install this extension: `code --install-extension properties-completion-1.0.0.vsix`.
